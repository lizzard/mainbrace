POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much 
as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations

Mt. Pise, CA    			KHB-49     162.40 MHz WX2

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - RADIOBEACONS
Only marine radiobeacons hyave been calibrated
for surface use.  Limitation on the use 
of certain other radio signals as aids to marine
navigation can be found in the U.S. Doast Guard
Light List and NGA Publication 117.
Radio direction-finding bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


AUTHORITIES

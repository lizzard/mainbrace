The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in 
San Francisco Bay and surrounding areas.  Vessels operating procedures and 
designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast 
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.  Mariners should consult these sources for 
applicable rules and reporting requirements.  Although mandatory VTS participation 
is limited to the navigable waters of the United States, certain vessels are encouraged 
or may be required, as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to facilitate 
advance vessel traffic management within the VTS area.”
